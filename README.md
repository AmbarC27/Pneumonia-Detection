Pneumonia Detection

This Binary Classification model used to detect pneumonia using chest X-rays has been built using a Convolutional Neural Network with 4 layers, using Tensorflow and Keras. The model depicts an accuracy of 95.6 % when tested over 580 images. I intend to extend onto this project in the near future by making it a part of a web application where the model is stored on the web, and the user can upload an image to check whether or not the patient whose chest X-ray is given has pneumonia or not.

The data used for this project can be found on https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia
